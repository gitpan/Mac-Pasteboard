Revision history for Perl extension Mac::Pasteboard.

0.000_01  Wed Jan  9 20:53:53 2008
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-b 5.6.0 -B -n Mac::Pasteboard pbl.h

0.000_02
  Added eg directory, with its one example.
  Fixed problem retrieving actual pasteboard name under 10.4 and above.

0.000_03
  Quashed compiler errors -- I hope, since I don't get them anyway.
  Added various output based on truth of $ENV{DEVELOPER_DEBUG}.

0.000_04
  Quash more compiler errors.
  Log malloc and free if $ENV{DEVELOPER_DEBUG} is true.
  Even more output if $ENV{DEVELOPER_DEBUG} is 'backtrace'.
  Eliminate free without malloc if pasteboard creation fails.
  Recognize coreFoundationUnknownErr as occurring if there is no access
    to pasteboards (e.g. cron job or ssh); modify tests and
    documentation accordingly.
  Use static attributes to control static methods; specifically 'fatal'
    to control whether new() throws an exception on error, and 'status'
    to record the status of new().
