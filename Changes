  Clean up compile warnings in XS code. The most significant change here
    is a correction in the size of the pasteboard flavor flags, from
    'unsigned long' to 'unsigned int' (or equivalent).
  Add metnods default_flavor() (to override the hard-wired default) and
    encode() (to encode data to and decode data from the UTF flavors).
  Add subtroutines pbflavor(), pbflavor_find(), pbencode(), and
    pbencode_find() to do the same thing for the convenience
    subroutines.
  Support pbflavor() and pbencode() in bin/pbtool.
  Support specifying the output encoding in bin/pbtool.
  Have the pbtool script dump the flavor flags in hex.

  Make Changes file Test::CPAN::Changes compliant. Add author test
    xt/author/changes.t to be sure it stays that way.
  Attempt to address the fact that Mac::Errors is optional, but the
    Cpants Kwalitee Game thinks it is required.

  Production version number. No other changes since 0.002_91.

  Document the fact that Mac::Pasteboard does not (yet) support the Mac
    OS 10.6 Snow Leopard functionality of placing more than one item on
    a pasteboard. Also document a workaround if the user is trying to
    write a droplet.
  Skip rather than fail when t/basic.t gets an error that indicates that
    we are forbidden to access the pasteboard. Enhance the skip message
    to include 'ssh session' as a possible reason for this.

  Converted to Perl-Foundation-recommended copyright and license.
  Dependencies now include _all_ modules, including core.
  Test::More 0.88 required for testing.
  Do author tests with Module::Build 'authortest' target. Move the
    author tests to xt/author/.
