  Make Changes file Test::CPAN::Changes compliant. Add author test
    xt/author/changes.t to be sure it stays that way.
  Attempt to address the fact that Mac::Errors is optional, but the
    Cpants Kwalitee Game thinks it is required.

  Document the fact that Mac::Pasteboard does not (yet) support the Mac
    OS 10.6 Snow Leopard functionality of placing more than one item on
    a pasteboard. Also document a workaround if the user is trying to
    write a droplet.
  Skip rather than fail when t/basic.t gets an error that indicates that
    we are forbidden to access the pasteboard. Enhance the skip message
    to include 'ssh session' as a possible reason for this.
