The tests were originally segregated into their own files because this
was the handiest way to segregate the tests of different functions. But
this causes fights over the clipboard when the tests are run in
parallel, resulting in test failures. Renaming the test files and then
just doing them seemed like the simplest way to serialize the whole
mess.
